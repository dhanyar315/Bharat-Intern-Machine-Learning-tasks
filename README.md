This is an ML model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn and TensorFlow.This is an ML model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The Iris Classification Machine Learning model is designed to accurately identify and classify iris flowers into three distinct species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Utilizing a dataset containing iris flower measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width),
